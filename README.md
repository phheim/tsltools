# TSL Tools Parser

This is a scalled-down version of [TSL Tools](https://github.com/reactive-systems/tsltools) mainly for feature for parsing TSL files. The reason for this is to archive a more long-term code-stability and availability, by avoiding unecessary dependencies. It was created for [Issy](https://github.com/phheim/issy).
